# News Site

In project we should make a classic new site that looked good on all screensizes using flexbox. 

## The problem
I looked at a lot of other sites and then made a sketch. I used flexbox and media queries to solve the problem. 

If I had more time I would work more on the css elements and add more text with overlay effect on the images with the news headings. And also add javascript to the hambuger menu so that it would work.
